# Prediction-and-detection-of-epileptic-seizures

This project was made in scope of the course Neural Computation and Diffuse Systems in the University of Coimbra.

The aim of this work is to create a classifier using Neural Networks in order to
predict and detect epileptic seizures. Our object of study was an EEG from two
different patients presenting 29 features. Knowing that a seizure is composed by 3 parts,
we developed two different neural networks, one for detecting and one for predicting
testing different architectures and varying different parameters.

I am aware that the network initiator might not be the most used currently, and that this project can be done with far greater success using TensorFlow
